# 🚀 Deep Dive into JavaScript: Interactive Registration Form & API Integration

Welcome to the **Deep Dive into JavaScript** project!  
This hands-on project is designed to solidify your understanding of **form validation**, **DOM manipulation**, and **asynchronous JavaScript** through real-world use cases.

You’ll build a fully functional **user registration form** with real-time validation, dynamic HTML interactions, and data fetching from a public API.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you’ll be able to:

### ✅ Implement Form Validation:
- Validate form inputs with JavaScript before submission.
- Apply conditions to ensure inputs like name, email, and password meet required criteria.
- Display real-time validation feedback (e.g., error messages, valid input indicators).

### ✅ Work with the DOM:
- Use JavaScript to dynamically update, style, and interact with HTML elements.
- Add and remove elements based on user input.
- Attach event listeners for user actions (e.g., `submit`, `keyup`, `click`).

### ✅ Master Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs:
- Use `fetch()` to retrieve data from a public API.
- Handle asynchronous responses using `.then()` or `async/await`.
- Dynamically insert API data into the webpage.
- Implement error handling to deal with failed network requests.

### ✅ Enhance User Experience:
- Give users **instant feedback** on form actions.
- Use **local storage** to persist data (e.g., remember submitted users or form values).
- Create a clean, responsive interface that feels modern and interactive.

## 📦 What You'll Build

- A **responsive registration form** with multiple input fields (e.g., name, email, password).
- **Form validation logic** with real-time feedback.
- A **section that fetches and displays user data** from a public API like [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) or [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/).
- A clear **feedback system** (error messages, success prompts).
- A touch of **data persistence** using `localStorage`.

---

## ✅ Project Requirements

- Use only **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Do **not** use external libraries, frameworks, or tools like jQuery, React, Vue, Bootstrap, etc.
- Code must be **W3C compliant** — validate using the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
- All files must **end with a new line**.
- A `README.md` file (this one!) is **mandatory** in the root of the project.
